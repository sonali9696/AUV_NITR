This project contains ROS package for Autonomous under water vehicle (AUV). A trial package called vn_100 is used for auv control , PID tuining,Sensor integration,Vision, GUI and graph ploting. This can be implemented in different packages according to its functionality too.
This project was created and maintained to contribute to the research in underwater exploration. We strive to achieve this through a student-led team that participiate in national competitions like SAVe in NIOT, Chennai and plan to participate in International competitions in near future.
To run tests on this code, make a directory (eg auv) and an src directory within it. Run command catkin_init_workspace while inside the src folder. Now come out of src folder and run catkin_make in auv folder. Copy the vn_100 package in src folder and run catkin_make again. Now you can run any files by rosrun command.
